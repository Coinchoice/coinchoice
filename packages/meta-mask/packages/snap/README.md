# Coinchoice Snap

This Snap allows users to fund their wallet with ETH before any transaction if they don't have enough to pay for gas.

## Notes

- Babel is used for transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript, so when building with the CLI,
  `transpilationMode` must be set to `localOnly` (default) or `localAndDeps`.
